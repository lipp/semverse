# semverse
A universe that follows SemVer constraints

## So what is this about ?
It's a nodejs service that exposes a REST API allowing you do to...well whatever you want :D

Start with a big bang, set some rules, and see it unravels itself ! I got this idea while looking for a mobile game that would be more about doing something new everytime than doing the same stuff over and over again. When I realized that my expectations would be near impossible to fulfill, I decided to do something about it and build my very own sandbox.

I also decided that I would apply as many best practices as possible:

- 100 percent unit test coverage
- JSLint compliance
- Functional programming all the way !
- Automatic semantic versioning

I also wanted to improve my nodejs skills by using some of its most useful
modules, like Swagger, Sequelize and Tape.

## Why "SemVerse"
Because I intend to follow the best practice of all, and since world building will be as incremental as possible, it made sense.

## How to get started
Well you can either try my very own instance, or deploy on your heroku account:

[![Deploy in your Heroku now !](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

If, as am I, you are more willing to do everything by yourself, you can just clone the repo and `npm start` right away: the default configuration should take care of everything.

See also the [GitHub Page](http://stephanetrebel.github.io/semverse) (Very very WIP)

## How to use
After starting/deploying the app go with your favorite browser to `/docs` and
you should see the Swagger UI with the basic controllers.

From that point, well, you're on your own !

## Contributing

Well, let's see how it goes first, and we'll see. I'm open to criticism and ideas, though, so feel free to create an Issue :D

## Licence

Do whatever the frack you want with it, as long as you link back to this repo.
So share away !
